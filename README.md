# Perceptron

The perceptron algorithm is a supervised learning of binary classifiers. 
It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

From output images in this repo we noticed that both the (AND, OR) bitwise operations were able to make good predictions on the y_true labels meaning they are linear classifiers
but the XOR bitwise operations had wrong predictions. This concludes that the XOR dataset is not linearly seperable and also not a binary classifier we will fix this using back propagation and my next repo update
